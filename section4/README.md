# Section 4

I created 2 versions of the graph displaying the number of covid-19 cases in Singapore over time:
1. Basic graph:
- section4_basic_graph.ipynb: script to get graph
- graph.png: displays a basic graph showing the number of covid-19 cases in Singapore over time

2. Value-added graph:
- The value-added graph displays a similar graph to the basic graph above. However, additional functionalities is added to this graph:
    - Functionality 1: able to view covid-19 cases by day, month and year (instead of just day as in the basic graph)
    - Functionality 2: able to filter for different date range to zoom in to the date range the user would like to see
- section4_value_added_graph.ipynb: script to get the value added graph which have more functionalities than basic graph
- value_added_graph_by_day.png: displayed the value-added graph using the 'Day' selection to view the covid-19 cases
- value_added_graph_by_month.png: displayed the value-added graph using the 'Month' selection to view the covid-19 cases (selected a different date range to show that the date filter is working as well)
- value_added_graph_by_year.png: displayed the value-added graph using the 'Year' selection to view the covid-19 cases
